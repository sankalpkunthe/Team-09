Task-01

1. First, I imported ultralytics to use YOLO, I imported the dataset as given using load_dataset

2. I used the model "yolo11n.pt" as told and tested on the images which are present in the dataset

3. I randomly selected 5 images and using ImageDraw (from PIL library), the model detected faces and drew red rectangle across it 

4. Finally matplotlib is used to display the image
